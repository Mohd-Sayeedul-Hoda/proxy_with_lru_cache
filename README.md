made proxy with lru cache in go

using double linked list to store cache and using hashmap to access the key from hashmap


*what i have to do that is important*

- add http.Response in value think so
- add to fetch all the cache after sometime automatically
- I have to add time to live in Node
- Have to add mutex support
